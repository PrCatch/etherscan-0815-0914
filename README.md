There are in total 6790 contracts submitted to Etherscan in the time window from 08/15/2022 to 09/14/2022. We use solc version 0.8.16 and slither version 0.8.3 to analyze those contracts. We successfully analyze 4324 contracts. Their hashes are in file white.list. 

Solc fails to compile 2454 contracts for five reasons: incompatible compiler version (2321), unexpected value or char (43), missing overridden contract (83), invalid license or multiple licenses (5), and contract file not found (2). 

Slither fails to analyze 12 contracts. 

The hashes of contracts we cannot handle are in file black.list.
